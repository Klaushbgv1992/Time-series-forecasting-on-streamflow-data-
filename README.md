# Time series forecasting on streamflow data
Effectively producing and analyzing monthly streamflow variability is essential for water resource management and development, which includes amongst others hydropower generation, flood defense and controlling, drought alleviation, river basin planning and management. This study, performs time series forecasting on streamflow data using an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to fit streamflow data as well as forecasting models in R. These different methods are compared to see which model fits the respective data better.
